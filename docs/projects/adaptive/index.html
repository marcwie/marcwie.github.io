    Visualization of the Adaptive Voter Model

<p>The <em>adaptive voter model</em> is a conceptual and one of the most prototypical models of
opinion dynamics. It was first introduced by <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.056108" target="_blank">Petter Holme and Mark Newman in
2006</a>
 and
still forms the basis of many studies conducted in my current research group.
It is motivated from the observation that in social networks like-minded
individuals tend to cluster in groups or communities. This effect may be
explained either by individuals becoming like-minded because they are connected
or by individuals connecting with each other because they are like-minded. The
latter is often denoted as &ldquo;homophily&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The model is comprised of a network with N (here N=50) nodes. Initially each
node carries one of G (here G=8) opinions. In each time step one node i is
chosen uniformly at random and one of the two following processes happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewiring/adaptation: With probability Φ one of the edges attached to i is moved to another
randomly chosen node with the same opinion as node i</li>
<li>Imitation: With probability 1-Φ node i copies the opinion of one of its
neighbors j</li>
</ul>
<p>The simulation ends once there are no more links between nodes of different
opinion. For low values of Φ the model converges into a state with one
giant component in which all nodes hold the same opinion. At intermediate Φ
the system undergoes a phase transition where the giant component vanishes and
the final distribution of cluster sizes follows a power law. For large Φ
the network quickly fragments and the size distribution of final clusters
approximately equals the initial distribution.</p>
<p>Use the buttons below to control the model. The buttons &ldquo;Slow&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Fast&rdquo; both start the simulation.  In the &ldquo;Slow&rdquo; mode you should be able to
follow exactly what is happening at each time step. Use the &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; mode to run
the model into its final state.  Use &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; to start over. The slider on the
right is used to adjust the rewiring probability Φ. This can only be changed when
the simulation is stopped.</p>
