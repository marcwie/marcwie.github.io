      <description>This is a visualization of my collaboration network. It is generated from the entries in my publication list . I have removed myself, i.e., the ego-node, as otherwise all co-authors would be connected to me and the network would become more star-like. Hover over the nodes to see which authors appear on the same papers. The width of the edges gives the frequency of collaborations between pairs of co-authors.

      <description>The adaptive voter model is a conceptual and one of the most prototypical models of opinion dynamics. It was first introduced by Petter Holme and Mark Newman in 2006 and still forms the basis of many studies conducted in my current research group. It is motivated from the observation that in social networks like-minded individuals tend to cluster in groups or communities. This effect may be explained either by individuals becoming like-minded because they are connected or by individuals connecting with each other because they are like-minded.</description>
