### News

**04 Oct. '21:** Our new
[paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00279-7)
investigates dose-responses functions for detecting signatures of complex
contagion in temporal network data sets. 

**26 Apr. '21:** Our paper in [The European Physical Journal Special Topics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-021-00011-5#citeas) shows that anticipation of future
environmental damages can lead to metastable states of collective
behaviour. 

**12 Feb. '21:** New paper in [Frontiers in Climate](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.618548/full)
which provides a spatially explicit and global overview on precipitation responses to different types of the
El Niño–Southern Oscillation.


**17 Mar. '21:** Our new paper concerning [Optimization of coupling and global
collapse in diffusively coupled socio-ecological resource exploitation
networks](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/abe0db) lead by
our former Master student Tanja Holstein is now published in [New Journal of
Physics.](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1367-2630)

**14 Oct. '20:** Our newest
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
paper proposes an analytical framework to characterize
potential social tipping processes for sustainability. The preprint is now
available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04488) and
[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708161).

**08 Jul. '20:** Our new paper on [A network-based microfoundation of
Granovetter’s threshold model for social
tipping](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67102-6) is now published
in Scientific Reports. It is part of the collection on [Social
physics](https://www.nature.com/collections/hfafjbjbgd) edited by Matjaž Perc.


**14 May '20:** [Geo.X](https://www.geo-x.net/) is a research network for Geosciences consisting of ten
partner institutions in the Berlin-Potsdam area. I am happy to announce
that I have been appointed as a postdoctoral member of their [Young
Academy](https://www.geo-x.net/young-academy/fellows-2019).


**04 May '20:** The description-paper of the copan:CORE World-Earth modeling
framework is now published in [Earth System
Dynamics](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/11/395/2020/). You can play around with the reference implementation available on [github](https://github.com/pik-copan/pycopancore).

**19 Dec. '19:** *Domino Effects in the Earth System -- The potential role of wanted tipping points* is the
title of the agenda-setting paper for our [DominoES
project](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes).
A revised version of the preprint is now available on the
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10063).

**3 Oct. '19:** I worked with Design students from the University of Applied
sciences Potsdam to create visual arts experiments of different Tipping
Elements in the Earth System. A video of the installations can be seen
[here](https://vimeo.com/363540500).


**25 Oct. '19:** Fabian Geier's (former master student with us at
[copan](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan)) paper
on [The physics of governance networks](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2019-900120-4)
is now published in EPJ ST.

**22 Oct. '19:** I had the fortune to co-author [Ilona
Otto's](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/banaszak/) paper on [Human agency in
the Anthropocene](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106463) which is now
published in Ecological Economics.

**19 Jun. '19:** Our new paper on *The physics of governance networks* is now
available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08679).

My work is part of the Leibniz Project
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
and the FutureLab on Game Theory & Networks of Interacting Agents
[Gane](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/futurelabs/gane). I am also a member
of the [copan
collaboration](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan).

Hi, I'm Marc. am a postdoc in the [Complexity
Science](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/complexity-science) department at
the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

My work is part of the Leibniz Project
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
and the FutureLab on Game Theory & Networks of Interacting Agents
[Gane](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/futurelabs/gane). I am also a member
of the [copan
collaboration](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan).

My interests are in complex networks, time series analysis, complex contagion and social tipping.

**05 Nov. '20:** I appeared at the [Scientists for Future
Podcast](https://s4f-podcast.de/) to discuss social and natural
tipping elements as well as their potential interactions. The full episode
(in German) is available on the [S4F
website](https://s4f-podcast.de/2020/11/s4f008-domino-erdsystem/),
[iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/folge-9-dominoeffekte-im-erdsystem/id1498309073?i=1000497379327)
