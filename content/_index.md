Hi, I'm Marc. I am a postdoc in the [Complexity
Science](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/complexity-science) department at
the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 

My work is part of the Leibniz Project
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
and the FutureLab on Game Theory & Networks of Interacting Agents
[Gane](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/futurelabs/gane).

My interests are in complex networks, time series analysis, complex contagion and social tipping.
