Hi, I'm Marc. I am a postdoc in the [Complexity
Science](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/complexity-science) department at
the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. 

My work is part of the Leibniz Project
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
and the FutureLab on Game Theory & Networks of Interacting Agents
[Gane](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/futurelabs/gane). I am also a member
of the [copan
collaboration](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan).

My interests are in complex networks, time series analysis, complex contagion and social tipping.

## News

**14 Oct. '20:** Our newest
[DominoES](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes)
paper proposes an analytical framework to characterize
potential social tipping processes for sustainability. The preprint is now
available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04488) and
[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708161).

**08 Jul. '20:** Our new paper on [A network-based microfoundation of
Granovetter’s threshold model for social
tipping](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67102-6) is now published
in Scientific Reports. It is part of the collection on [Social
physics](https://www.nature.com/collections/hfafjbjbgd) edited by Matjaž Perc.

**14 May '20:** [Geo.X](https://www.geo-x.net/) is a research network for Geosciences consisting of ten
partner institutions in the Berlin-Potsdam area. I am happy to announce
that I have been appointed as a postdoctoral member of their [Young
Academy](https://www.geo-x.net/young-academy/fellows-2019).

**04 May '20:** The description-paper of the copan:CORE World-Earth modeling
framework is now published in [Earth System
Dynamics](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/11/395/2020/). You can play around with the reference implementation available on [github](https://github.com/pik-copan/pycopancore).

**19 Dec. '19:** *Domino Effects in the Earth System -- The potential role of wanted tipping points* is the 
title of the agenda-setting paper for our [DominoES
project](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/dominoes). 
A revised version of the preprint is now available on the
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10063).

**3 Oct. '19:** I worked with Design students from the University of Applied
sciences Potsdam to create visual arts experiments of different Tipping
Elements in the Earth System. A video of the installations can be seen
[here](https://vimeo.com/363540500).

<!-- 
**25 Oct. '19:** Fabian Geier's (former master student with us at
[copan](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/projects/activities/copan)) paper
on [The physics of governance networks](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2019-900120-4)
is now published in EPJ ST.

**22 Oct. '19:** I had the fortune to co-author [Ilona
Otto's](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/banaszak/) paper on [Human agency in
the Anthropocene](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106463) which is now
published in Ecological Economics.

**19 Jun. '19:** Our new paper on *The physics of governance networks* is now
available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08679).
