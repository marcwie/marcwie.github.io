This is a visualization of my collaboration network. It is generated from the
entries in my [publication list](/publications/). I have removed myself, i.e.,
the ego-node, as otherwise all authors would be connected to me. Hover over the
nodes to see which authors appear on the same papers. The width of the edges
gives the frequency of collaborations between pairs of co-authors.
